;; `kotoba/postal_core.kotoba`'s `valid-postal?`, against the `kiyaku.account`
;; that ships.
;;
;; ONE artifact. Until kotoba-lang/amu#912 (2026-09-09) a module that declared
;; `:schemas` could not be required, `pattern-vm` is records throughout, and
;; this file compiled the table and the matcher separately and put them
;; together itself -- so the question the `.cljc` actually asks, `valid-postal?`,
;; existed in neither artifact and was assembled here. It is now one Kotoba
;; function, and this file only asks it.
;;
;; The oracle is the namespace itself -- `valid-postal?` with its six regex
;; literals -- so this compares the compiled patterns with the regexes they
;; were compiled from, on inputs chosen at the edges of each format.
;;
;; Exit codes: 0 passed, 1 disagreement, 2 REFUSED.
